### Background

Photogrammetry involves taking overlapping, precise photos of the object being digitized. This usually involves using a digital single lens reflex camera - usually called a DSLR, often in manual mode, to create a precise set of overlapping images. 

Those who aren't familiar with manual studio photography should review the following links:

### Key Settings

Now that you've familiarized yourself with these concepts, keep in mind these settings for our purposes:

-We aim for an F/Stop around F/13 or F/11. 

-Our ISO must be below 400, ideally at: 200, 250, or 320. Do not go above 320 without consulting the digitization manager.

-Our shutter speed is usually 1/40 or 1/60. Anything slower than 1/40th is too slow and more light needs to be added, a lower f stop used, or a higher film speed.

-The camera needs to be in remote operation mode to be able to be controlled by the Foldio app.

-Shooting in Aperture priority mode is recommended.

-Make sure to position the turntable with the zero degree mark facing the front of the shot.

-Make sure to use the start and stop cards for each Level, as otherwise it is very confusing to sort the files later.

#### Necessary Equipment

- DSLR Camera
- Tripod
- Foldio studio set with photobooth w/backdrop, lights, extra lights, and turntable
- IPad with Foldio App configured
- Level 
- Blue Painter’s tape
- Artifact
- Clay 
- Dusting medium and materials
- Transport tray/plate for transport to studio from dusting space
- Mini wooden blocks for adjusting lights

### Views and Levels

Each artifact will need 6, 360 rotations to capture it. To help keep track of these we use the same terminology consistenly as follows:

Views - Refers to the objects orientation, each shoot will have a View 1, and then a View 2 where the object is flipped.

Levels - Levels refers to the camera's height. For each View (aka orientation) of the object, we need to take shots at three different camera heights, referred to as levels 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Level 1 is always the horizontal shot, Level 2 is always the medium shot, and Level 3 is always the heighest shot.

### Camera Fundamentals

__In general, do not change camera settings outside of the aperture (f-stop), shutter speed, and ISO (film speed)__


For high quality results, you want to take every photo with exactly the same camera settings so the photographs are consistent when you start working with them in Metashape. This means both taking photos of the object from the same position every time (you’ll change the height of the camera at least three times to take 3 circuits of photos) so that the object is consistently framed in the photograph and adjusting the settings on your camera so that the color, focus, capture settings are the same for every photo. It is important to have a general understanding of how different settings on your DSLR camera can impact your photographs. The following steps will help you set up your camera to produce the crispest image possible with accurate color representation.

#### Basic Camera Settings

##### All cameras
- Set your camera to shoot in RAW.
- Set mode to Manual or (For beginners, try using Aperture priority—AV on a Canon or A on a Nikon)
- Set to never turn off
- Tape the lens down with painters’ tape to hold the place of the zoom.
- If the lens has ‘image stabilization’ or ‘vibration reduction’ turn it OFF (usually a switch on the lens itself.)

##### Optional Adjustments
- Set camera from live view to grid view
- Turn off AF beep when using live view (on Canon)
- Set back button for focus (functionality of half shutter press is transferred to back button)
- Set the camera to not shoot if no SD or CF card is present.

#### Position your Camera
It is important to position your camera in the exact environment where you plan on taking photos before you change any of the following settings.

- We suggest starting with your camera and tripod positioned on the same horizontal plane as your object- e.g. your camera should be aligned directly with the center of your object. You’ll move it up and down later. Use a tripod that has an adjustable central pole so that you don’t have to move the feet of the tripod, but just the camera up or down. Make sure you position the central pole in the middle of its height range so that you are able to adjust up or down later. __Picture__
- Taping where the tripods feet are on the floor can help to make sure you don't move the tripod and is recommended for beginners. __Picture__
- Check to make sure your camera base is level.
- Place your object in the center of the turntable and position your camera tripod such that the entire object is visible. __Make sure that when you rotate the object it doesn’t move out of the frame!__ If possible, avoid including the edges of the lightbox or edge of your black background in the photo frame; this will make masking much easier later on.
- Lighting: You want your object to be as well illuminated as possible while minimizing glare. Experiment with placing the lights and adjusting the heights using the provided mini wooden blocks.

#### Staging and Camera Adjustments

Begin by putting your dusted artifact onto the center of the turntable. Push down on the base of the adhereing clay to make sure there is a good attachment. If the object falls over you will have to like repowdered it and for sure redo that photo set.

Each artifact will have 6 complete rotations taken. The first set are three, 360 views of the object, taken from three different heights. We then flip the object upside down, which involves re-powdering and re-attaching it with clay to the turntable, and repeat the process. The end result for each object will be six folder sets that contain the photos comprising each view.

For this process to work correctly, we must hold as many variables identical as possible. Below are lists of what settings will change and when:

-For the whole shoot we __must__ use the same:
__ISO/film speed__
__Aperture/f-stop__
__Zoom/focal distance__
__positioning of the feet of tripod (aka we cannot move the tripod closer or further)__

Practically these steps mean once we start shooting we cannot change the zoom of the camera, either intenbtionally to capture more or less information, or by accident via bumping it. We also must not use a mode that automatically changes the aperture/f-stop. The ISO is the least likely to be changed inadvertently over the coruse of the shoot.

For each view of the object these settings will change:

__the focus will change for each view (horizontal, mid, high) but must be held consistent within that view__ __DO NOT use autofocus__

Steps:
1. Place object into center of turntable and scurely adhere to base with clay.
If the object falls over you must restart the whole series for that View (aka redo all three heights).
2. Power lights up to maximum brightness using the controller and place to light the object.
3. Position the camera so it is exactly level with the object. __Picture__
4. Adjust the camera to Aperture priority mode and set the aperture to F/11 or F/13.
5. Test how well the camera is focusing by using the autozoom and seeing how many points register as focusing by half way depressing the shutter or touching the touch screen. 
6. If not enough appears to be in focus, adjust the tripod's distance from the camera or adjust the zoom on the camera. Do not go below 24mm on the zoom. Expect to be about around 50-75mm most of the time.
7. Once you have achieved satisfactory focusing options, test that the tripod distance will work at the more extreme angle by raising the tripod to the max height and more extreme top down view angle. __Picture__. 
8. Once you have a good balance of zoom and tripod distance that gets the whole object with as many focus points as possible at both the extreme ends of the sequence (the horizontal view and the max upright view), use tape to mark the tripod's foot placement and to hold the camera's zoom. __Picture__.
9. Test that there is enough lighting by confirming with a few test shots that the camera is shooting at 1/40 or faster. If you see the camera is doing a lower setting, motion/blur can be introduced by the longer shutter times and you need to get more light.
10. Set the camera to be in manual focus. The easiest way to do this while getting sharp focus throughout is to have the camera in Autofocus mode and taking a picture with that setting first. Then, __without moving the focus rings__ set the lens back to manual focus. Your shot should now be at the same autofocus exposure, but set in manual mode. What this means is that the camera won't autofocus on each turn of the base, but instead preserve that original focus throughout.
11. Open the Foldio App and ensure the camera is connect by clicking Test Shot. If you're using the system for the first time, you may need to connect to the foldio turnable (under settings). Once connected there, click the Camera 360 setting and under "Camera Brand" select Canon. Click "Test Shot" and confirm that the camera has taken a picture.
12. For the foldio rotate, use the 24 photos setting. Make sure to position the turntable with the zero degree mark facing the front of the shot. The foldio has a setting that accounts for the delay in communicating with the camera. If you notice the camera can't keep up with the base, contact the digitization manager about how to change that timer to a longer amount. 
13. Allow the foldio rotate to complete a complete 360 rotation of the object. Make sure to use the start and stop markers to indicate when you are starting and stopping each level. For each clay setting you will take a horizontal view, a mid view, and a high view.
14. Move the camera to a mid height setting, about halfway up the pole that raises the camera head up. __Picture__ 
15. Repeat the focusing step (Step 10) of switching to Autofocus and then back to manual. __DO NOT CHANGE THE APERTURE or any other settings__. 
16. Use the foldio app to make a 360 rotation at this second level. 
17. Make sure to measure the tripod height and make a note of it for when you shoot View 2 - Level 2.
18. Repeat the process for the highest view. 
19. Flip the artifact, redust, and start the process over from the horizontal level. The camera will need to be refocused for each level. Do not change other camera settings.



#### Evaluating photos
Whenever you have a change in the set-up, take a few sample photos and check them on the view screen.

- Is the object in focus?
- Is the depth of field deep enough?
- Check your lighting: Is the object casting any dark shadows?
- Are the lights in the shot?
- Is the image too dark or too light? 
- Is your camera tripod positioned such that the entire object is visible, and the edges of the lightbox aren’t visible in the frame?
- Is the object centered on the turntable so that when you rotate it, it will stay centered in your frame?
- Is there dust or debris on the background? If so, use the lint roller to get rid of it!
- Write down your ISO, F/stop and shutter speed settings for the first round of photos in case something happens with the settings when you move your camera to a new angle and change the focus.

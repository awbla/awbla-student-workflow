#### Daily camera set-up
Insert SD card into SD Card slot, turn on camera using the power switch, make sure battery is charged and insert it in the battery slot.


Turn on LV mode and follow the steps below. These steps will need to be ***REDONE each time the camera is turned on***

{% include figure.html img="monitorhue.jpg" alt="" caption="Im" width="65%" %}


Here are the above steps in a different way: 
Looking at the camera's monitor
- Press and hold the Zoom-out button, move arrow keys on the multi-selector until box 2 (as indicated on the image below) is highlighted in yellow, it may already be highlighted, if it is, move to the next step
- Keeping the Zoom-out button pressed, turn the **main dial** until it shows "PRE" (turn dial left once)

{% include figure.html img="cameradisplay.jpg" alt="" caption="" width="65%" %}


Then set the correct *White Balance* (*WB*) preset (“PRE”) based on the color background you have. You will need to reset the *WB* every time a new background color is used. 
Walk around the table so you can see the Control panel 
- Press and hold the **WB** button and scroll through the options with the **sub-command dial** 

**WB Presets**
- D-1 = black
- D-2 = white 
- D-3 = gray

### Taking the shot

#### Make sure you:
1. Use the lint roller or canned air to clean any dust off the background felt, this may need to be done more than once a session.
2. *Wear gloves* when using the white background.
3. Use kneeded eraser/modeling clay to hold artifact for the photo if needed.
4. Only use **LV** mode when positioning new object, otherwise TURN OFF.  It drains the battery and slows the photo taking process.
5. Turn on remote shutters:
          6. Turn on the two Pixel Pro Wireless Remote Controls by pressing and holding the **On** button till screen displays **“CH 01”**.
          7. Use large button to focus, push down half-way and hold, finish pushing down to take the photo. 
          8. On **LV** the red box will turn green and a beep will sound when focus is achieved.

### General Set-up 

#### Small artifacts 
- To set-up turn on **LV** 
- Keep both scale and color bar horizontal and lower the camera to the appropriate level and adjust as needed.
- Align artifact in center of **CM scale** and ensure it is straight, use camera gridlines to help. 
- Move *red focus box* (green in the photo example) to center of artifact using **multi selector** 
- Turn OFF **LV** mode 

{% include figure.html img="smallartifact.jpg" alt="" caption="" width="65%" %}

#### Large artifacts 
- To set-up turn on **LV**
- Color bar remains horizontal and CM scale can be moved vertically 
- Align artifact in center of scale and ensure it is straight, use camera gridlines to help. 
- Move *red focus box* (green in the photo example) to center of artifact using **multi selector** 
- Turn OFF **LV** mode 

{% include figure.html img="largeartifact.jpg" alt="" caption="" width="65%" %}


#### Taking photos
Each drawer will have a printed list of all artifacts to keep track of your progress.
- Always photograph the side of the artifact with the catalog number FIRST. 
    - If it is not visible, write "cat #" on the small “whiteboard” and include on first image, then remove and photograph artifact. 
- Photograph both sides of artifact and ENSURE that the orientation is the SAME for front and back, just flip it over, DO NOT rotate 
    - If another view is needed to understand the artifact, please photograph this view and **refer to naming convensions below**.
- If you do not know how the artifact should be placed, check out the cheat sheet or ask for help. 

- Keep **CM Scale** as straight as possible, use gridlines on camera (LV) to help. 
- The **color bar** and the **CM scale** need to be in each photograph, the gray portion of the **color bar** can be cut out to achieve a closer image
- Use best judgments when choosing background color, it is always okay to try on multiple colors.
- It may be easier to photograph all artifacts that need white background and then switch colors. 
    - Use the printed list to keep track of which artifacts have been photographed.

## Processing images 

Create a *main object folder*. Will be named as follows:
{% capture text %}ex. **CE_CD_D2** is Crabtree Collection, Cabinet D, Drawer 2{% endcapture %}
{% include alert.html text=text color="danger" %} 

Within each *main object folder* create folders that match the image below. 
{% include figure.html img="folderlist.JPG" alt="" caption="" width="65%" %}

Use the SD card reader to upload images to the JPEG folder and process within this folder. 

From experience, it is easier to sort through images by editing first and then rename. Crop all images you wish to keep and do not edit those you do not want. All uncropped JPGs and their corresponding RAW files can be moved to the Test Shot folder. Then what is left simply needs renaming. 
**RAW files are.NEF**
ANY image you do not use can live in the Test shots folder - better than deleting incase you move the wrong photo

### Edit images 
- Double click on photo in file explorer to open the image in Photos, the program we will use in this phase of processing. 
- Rotate JPG images so **CM scale** is horizontal.
- Crop **color bar** out of JPG ONLY, RAW file stays the same. 

Refer to the image below to determine how to crop. **Do NOT** crop too close to the top of the artifact. Around the **CM scale** crop approximately 1/8” of "daylight", just like in our document scans! Ensure this daylight is EVEN on right and left of CM scale, the bottom can be less. 

{% include figure.html img="daylightexample.jpg" alt="" caption="" width="65%" %}

Straighten images as needed in **Photos** with sliding scale pictured below. This is not as precise as Photoshop, so use your best judgment.

{% include figure.html img="crop.jpg" alt="" caption="" width="65%" %}

### Naming images 
 
Each artifact will have **4 final images** associated with it (sometimes more) 2 jpg and 2 raw (NEF) files.

{% capture text %}Example of renaming: Artifact 1234 from Cabinet D, Drawer 4 will be “CE_CD_D4_1234-a”, “CE_CD_D4_1234-b” (use -c, d, e for subsequent views) for each file type.{% endcapture %}

{% include alert.html text=text color="danger" %} 

Keep all JPG and RAW files in one folder - this allows for easier processing and renaming. 

{% include figure.html img="renaming.JPG" alt="" caption="" width="65%" %}

Once all images are renamed: sort images by type and move files to their corresponding folders.

Then TIF files will be created from the RAW files using Photoshop 
- Go to "File" > "Scripts" > "Image Processor" and select your Drawers RAW folder to convert to TIFs  
- Use "File" > > "Automate" > "Batch Process" to convert the TIFs from 300 to 600 dpi (our required dpi for the project) 


### List the file names in our Library Metadata List 

Copy and paste the directory link from File Explorer **"C:\Users\yourname\OneDrive - University of Idaho\CLIR-DHC Crabtree\2D Artifact Photos\Processed-JPEG\CE_CB_D1"** into a Internet browser. To select all use "Control + A" and then copy with "Control + C". Paste these in an empty Excel sheet using right click to keep text only! 

Open Find and Replace "Control + H" and type ".jpg" into the Find box and leave the Replace box empty this will leave our file names with the correct conventions. Copy and paste these rows into the "File Name" column in the correct library drop Excel sheet. 

For the Date column, highlight the entire column and in the Find box type: ,*  as we want to delete all information AFTER the comma leaving the date ex."5/23/2022". Once copied over to the Metadata sheet you will need to format the column to ensure it is in the correct format "2022-05-23" 

To isolate the Catalog number and add Ce. preform these steps: 

Copy the file name into the **CatNumber** column and Find and Replace everything except the Cat #. Example: for Cabinet D, Drawer 3 (CE_CD_D3_#-LETTER) type in to the Find box **"*_"** (*underscore) and then **"-*"** (dash*).

From here, create a new temporary column. In the cell left of the first cat # type: **="Ce."&** then like other formulas select all boxes you want this to be applied to and hit Enter. Then highlight the results and hover over the edge of the column until you see the black four arrow pointer appear - DRAG with RIGHT CLICK to Cat # column and select "Copy as Values". 
 
    
**Hard drive upload**
Photos will go loose into "2D-Objects" in "JPEG-Website" and "TIF"

## Just in case

   **If things get out of order refer to this section to reset the camera to our preferred settings** 
   
Prior to shooting, make sure **Manual Mode** is selected, **shutter speed is 125**, the **f stop is 8**, and **ISO is 100**. All should be set and locked with these settings and should remain the same even after camera is shut off. For details on changing these, see below. 

{% include figure.html img="displaysettings.jpg" alt="" caption="" width="80%" %}

Mode: 
***Manual Mode (M on camera)*** 
- To change hold “MODE” button down, above LED screen and rotate dial near right thumb (main dial)

ISO: 
***400-100, most likely 100*** 
- To change ISO - hold ISO button on left side dial and turn dial near right thumb (main dial)

Fstop: 
***F8***
- To LOCK/UNLOCK settings, press and hold FN button and rotate the **sub-command dial** until an “L” appears/disappears by the shutter speed
- Hold shutter button half way down (like you are focusing a shot) and turn the dial directly below the on/off switch on the front of the camera

Shutter speed:
**125 - 80** depending on background color 
- To LOCK/UNLOCK, press and hold **FN button** and rotate **main dial** until an “L” appears/disappears by the shutter speed
- To change – hold shutter button down half way, same as above, and rotate **main dial**

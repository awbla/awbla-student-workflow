### Important terminology 
          LV mode 
          main dial 
          sub-command dial 
          WB 
          multi-selector 

{% capture text %}**Before you start**: Refer to page 2 in Nikon D800 Manual for "Getting to Know the Camera" to learn about the camera you are about to use. These pages are printed and hung by the 2D station for reference. {% endcapture %}
{% include alert.html text=text color="danger" %}
          

#### Daily camera set-up

Insert SD card, turn on camera, make sure battery is charged, turn on **LV mode** and follow the steps below. These steps will need to be ***REDONE each time the camera is turned on***

Looking at the camera's monitor
- Press and hold the button indicated in the 'Adjusting Monitor Hue' image above, move arrow keys until box 2 (as indicated on the image below) is highlighted (Step 1)
- Keeping the same button pressed, turn the **main dial** until it shows "PRE" (turn dial left once) (Step 2)

![cameradisplay](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504896/183751877-3c56c9ff-6b07-41a4-8912-ad2a9ff2f204.jpg)

Then set the correct *White Balance* (*WB*) preset (“PRE”) based on the color background you have. You will need reset the *WB* every time a new background color is used. 

Looking at the LED screen/control panel
- Press and hold **WB** button and scroll through the options with **sub-command dial** 

#### WB Presets 
- D-1 = black
- D-2 = white 
- D-3 = gray

### Taking the shot



#### Make sure you:
1. Use the lint roller or canned air to clean any dust off the background felt, this may need to be done more than once a session.
1. *Wear gloves* when using the white background.
1. Use kneeded eraser to hold artifact for the photo if needed.
1. Turn off **LV** mode often. It drains the battery and slows the photo taking process.

- Each drawer will have a printed list of all artifacts to keep track of your progress.
- Always photograph the side of the artifact with the catalog number FIRST. 
- If it is not visible, use small “whiteboard” to write cat # in on first image, remove and photograph artifact. 
- Photograph both sides of artifact and ENSURE that the orientation is the SAME for front and back, just flip it over, DO NOT rotate 
    - If another view is needed to understand the artifact, please photograph. Refer to naming convensions below.
- If you do not know how the artifact should be placed, see OBJECT on printed Drawer list or ask Allison or Leah. 

- Keep **CM Scale** as straight as possible, use gridlines on camera (LV) to help. 
- The **color bar** and the **CM scale** need to be in each photograph, the gray portion of the **color bar** can be cut out to achieve a closer image
- Use best judgments when choosing background color

#### Small artifacts 
- To set-up turn on **LV** 
- Keep both scale and color bar horizontal and lower the camera to the appropriate level and adjust as needed.
- Align artifact in center of **CM scale** and ensure it is straight, use gridlines to help. 
- Move *red focus box* to center of artifact using **multi selector** 
- Turn OFF **LV** mode

#### Large artifacts 
- To set-up turn on **LV**
- Color bar remains horizontal and CM scale can be moved vertically 
- Align artifact in center of scale and ensure it is straight, use gridlines to help. 
- Move *red focus box* to center of artifact using **multi selector** 
- Turn OFF **LV** mode 

![largeartifact](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504896/184460833-72bf955d-d0c5-4c04-af5e-eb57296f65d3.jpg)

#### Remote shutter
Turn on the two Pixel Pro Wireless Remote Controls by pressing and holding the On button till screen displays “CH 01”. This will enable you to take the photos without using the shutter button. 

Use large button to focus, push down half-way and hold, finish pushing down to take the photo. On **LV** the red box will turn green and a beep will sound when focus is achieved.

## Processing images 

Create a folder for the drawer you photographed in each file type folder JPEG, RAW and TIFF as well as the Test Shots-Errors folder. 
{% capture text %}ex. **CE_CD_D2** is Crabtree Collection, Cabinet D, Drawer 2{% endcapture %}
{% include alert.html text=text color="danger" %} 

Use the SD card reader to upload images to the JPEG folder and process within this folder. 

Crop and Rename Images 
- Double click on photo in file explorer, this will open Photos, the program we will use in this phase of processing. 
- Rotate JPG images so **CM scale** is horizontal.
- Crop **color bar** out of JPG ONLY, RAW file stays the same. 

Refer to the image below to determine how to crop. **Do NOT** crop too close to the top of the artifact. Around the **CM scale** crop approximately 1/8” of "daylight", just like in our document scans! Ensure this daylight is EVEN on right and left of CM scale, the bottom can be less. 

![daylightexample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504896/183745618-1d930bdc-ad77-481e-82d8-9ce86435b02b.jpg)

Straighten images as needed in **Photos** with sliding scale pictured below. This is not as precise as Photoshop, so use your best judgment.

### Naming images 
 
Each artifact will have 4 images assocaited with it (sometimes more) 2 jpg and 2 raw (NEF) files.     Example of renaming: Artifact 1234 from Cabinet D, Drawer 4 will be “CE_CD_D4_1234-a”             “CE_CD_D4_1234-b” (use -c, d, e for subsequent views) for each file type.

Sort images by type and move all RAW files to their corresponding folder in RAW
    Batch process all RAW files from a session in Photoshop to Tif files. 
    List the file names in the Metadata List 
    
**Hard drive Upload**
Photos will go in 2D-Objects in JPEG-Website and TIF

## Just in case

   **If things get out of order refer to this section to reset the camera to our preferred settings** 
   
Prior to shooting, make sure **Manual Mode** is selected, **shutter speed is 125** and the **f stop is 8** and **ISO is 100**. All should be set and locked with these settings and should remain the same even after camera is shut off. For details on changing these, see below. 

![displaysettings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504896/183745670-800a5bdd-794a-44a0-9fc0-d0c7ec990030.jpg)

Mode: 
***Manual Mode (M on camera)*** 
- To change hold “MODE” button down, above LED screen and rotate dial near right thumb (main dial)

ISO: 
***400-100, most likely 100*** 
- To change ISO - hold ISO button on left side dial and turn dial near right thumb (main dial)

Fstop: 
***F8***
- Hold shutter button half way down (like you are focusing a shot) and turn the dial directly below the on/off switch on the front of the camera
- To LOCK/UNLOCK settings, press and hold FN button and rotate the **sub-command dial** until an “L” appears/disappears by the shutter speed

Shutter speed:
**125** 
- To change – hold shutter button down half way, same as above, and rotate **main dial** 
- To LOCK/UNLOCK, press and hold **FN button** and rotate **main dial** until an “L” appears/disappears by the shutter speed

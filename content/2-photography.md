## Taking the Shot
Turn on the 2 Pixel Pro Wireless Remote Controls by pressing and holding the On button till screen displays “CH 01”. This will enable you to take the photos without using the shutter button.
-	Always photograph the side of the artifact with the catalog number FIRST. 
- If it is not visible, use small “whiteboard” to write cat # in on first image, remove and photograph artifact. 
- Photograph both sides of artifact and ENSURE that the orientation is the SAME for front and back, just flip it over, DO NOT rotate 

- Keep **CM Scale** as straight as possible, use gridlines on camera (LV) to help. 
- The **color bar** and the **CM scale** need to be in each photograph, the gray portion of the **color bar** can be cut out to achieve a closer image
### Small Artifacts

- Keep both scale and color bar horizontal and lower the camera to the appropriate level and adjust as needed.
- Align artifact in center of scale and ensure it is straight, use gridlines to help. 
- Move *red focus box* to center of artifact using **multi selector**

### Daily Camera set-up

Insert SD card, turn on camera, make sure bettery is charged, turn on **LV mode** and follow the following steps 

- Move arrow keys until 2 on the image below is highlighted, then turn the **main dial** until it shows "PRE" (turn dial left once). This must be redone each time the camera is turned on.

- Then set the correct *White Balance* preset (“PRE”) based on the color background you have. You will need to repeat this step every time a new background color is used. 
- Press and hold **WB** button and scroll through the options with **sub-command dial** 
> D-1 = black 
> D-2 = white 
> D-3 = gray

### Taking the Shot

-	Always photograph the side of the artifact with the catalog number FIRST. 
- If it is not visible, use small “whiteboard” to write cat # in on first image, remove and photograph artifact. 
- Photograph both sides of artifact and ENSURE that the orientation is the SAME for front and back, just flip it over, DO NOT rotate 

- Keep **CM Scale** as straight as possible, use gridlines on camera (LV) to help. 
- The **color bar** and the **CM scale** need to be in each photograph, the gray portion of the **color bar** can be cut out to achieve a closer image

### Small Artifacts 
- To set-up turn on **LV** 
- Keep both scale and color bar horizontal and lower the camera to the appropriate level and adjust as needed.
- Align artifact in center of scale and ensure it is straight, use gridlines to help. 
- Move *red focus box* to center of artifact using **multi selector** 
{% include figure.html img="smallartifact.jpg" alt="graphic showing small artifact set up" caption="" width="75%" %}

### Large Artifacts 
- To set-up turn on **LV**
- Color bar remains horizontal and CM scale can be moved vertically 
- Align artifact in center of scale and ensure it is straight, use gridlines to help. 
- Move *red focus box* to center of artifact using **multi selector** 
{% include figure.html img="largeartifact.jpg" alt="graphic showing large artifact set up" caption="" width="75%" %}

### Remote Shutter
Turn on the 2 Pixel Pro Wireless Remote Controls by pressing and holding the On button till screen displays “CH 01”. This will enable you to take the photos without using the shutter button. 

Use large button to focus, push down half-way and hold, and take photo, finish pushing down.

## Processing Images 

Create a folder for the drawer you photographed in each file type folder JPEG, RAW and TIFF as well as the Test Shots-Errors folder. 
          ex. CE_CD_D2 is Cabinet D, Drawer 2 
          Photos will be loose in these folders

Use the SD card reader to upload images to the JPEG folder and process within this folder. 

Crop and Rename Images 
- Double click on photo in file explorer, this will open Photos, the program we will use in this phase of processing. 
- Rotate JPG images so CM scale is horizontal.
- Crop color bar out of JPG ONLY, RAW file stays the same. Do NOT crop too close to the top of the artifact. Make sure some of the background is visible near CM scale 1/8” of daylight, just like in our document scans! Ensure this daylight is EVEN on right and left of CM scale, the bottom can be less. 

Straighten images as needed in **Photos** with sliding scale pictured below. This is not as precise as Photoshop, so use your best judgment.

### Renaming Images 
 
Each artifact will have 4 images assocaited with it (sometimes more) 2 jpg and 2 raw (NEF) files.     Example of renaming: Artifact 1234 from Cabinet D, Drawer 4 will be “CE_CD_D4_1234-a”             “CE_CD_D4_1234-b” (use -c, d, e for subsequent views) for each file type.

Sort images by type and move all RAW files to their corresponding folder in RAW
    Batch process all RAW files from a session in Photoshop to Tif files. 
    List the file names in the Metadata List 
    
   
   **Hard drive Upload**
   Photos will go in 2D-Objects in JPEG-Website and TIF
